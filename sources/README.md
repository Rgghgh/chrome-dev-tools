# Sources

One of the developer tools most powerful features is the sources tab. This section is essentially an integrated development environment which allows you to build, test, and debug web apps.

#### Navigate within the sources tab with the following shortcuts

| key-stroke | Action |
| :---: | --- |
| `ctrl` + `F` | Search text within the current file |
| `ctrl` + `shift` + `F` | Search text accross all files\* |

\* Available in all tabs \(network, sources, elements, etc\)
